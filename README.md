This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). Styling is done using Chakra-UI.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the app.

Connect your Ethereum wallet and click "Show Stamps".

You should see your stamps displayed in the browser. Icons are common to all stamps issued by a single provider. To see which specific stamp an icon represents, hover the cursor over it - the stamp name will be displayed.
